N Back is commonly used to improve working memory 
and fluid intelligence.

Read about it here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back

A GUI version is available here - http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/

I wanted something similar on the command line,
so that I could play quickly when I want to unwind.

Currently, it can be executed as 
python nback.py -n='value of n' -op='some file name'
